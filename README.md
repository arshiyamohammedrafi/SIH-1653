 Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

Idea
1. Virtual Board Room Simulation
Multi-Panel Expert Interface: A digital platform where panel members can collaboratively conduct interviews.
AI-Generated Ice-Breaking Questions: The system will initiate interviews with structured introductory questions.
Adaptive Questioning System: AI will suggest follow-up questions based on candidate responses, ensuring the interview remains focused and relevant.
2. AI-Based Question Relevancy Scoring
Question-Expertise Mapping: AI will match each question posed by the panel to the candidate’s domain expertise to ensure relevance.
Weightage Allocation: More relevant and insightful questions will have higher weightage in final scoring.
3. AI-Assisted Candidate Response Evaluation
Semantic Analysis of Responses: AI will assess the depth, technical accuracy, and relevance of candidate responses.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Knowledge Graphs: The system will analyze spoken or written responses against predefined knowledge bases to score relevancy.
4. Quantifiable Score Generation
Scoring Algorithm:
Score for question relevance (Expert’s Question w.r.t. Candidate’s Domain)
Score for response quality (Candidate’s Answer w.r.t. Question)
Overall Score Calculation: Weighted average of all responses to determine subject-matter competency.
Real-time Dashboard: Provides interviewers with detailed insights into candidate performance.
5. AI-Powered Bias Reduction
Anonymized Candidate Profiles: The system can mask personal identifiers to prevent unconscious bias.
Objective Scoring Metrics: Ensures decisions are based on performance rather than subjective impressions.
